## Code Structures

`handler.js`: This file provides the logic for dealing with requests and responses. It serves as a bridge between the routes and the data.

`books.js`: Represents the book collection's data structure. This file contains an array or interacts with a database to store and retrieve book information.

`server.js`: Starts the server and configures it as needed. Initializes an HTTP server with a framework such as Hapi.

`routers.js`: Specifies the app's routes. This file translates HTTP methods and endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to the proper handler functions in `handler.js`.
